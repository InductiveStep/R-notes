# Preface {-}

These notes are based on weekly tutorial sheets I developed for a postgraduate social science course in 2020 to complement weekly lectures and online tutorials. They were written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), using the [`bookdown` package](https://bookdown.org/).^[The GitHub repository is [over here](https://github.com/InductiveStep/R-notes).]

The core texts we used were Fox and Weisberg (2019), [An R Companion to Applied Regression (Third Edition)](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/) and Healy (2019) [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/) -- both fabulous for learning applied statistics using R.

All the datasets used are available in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-CRAN_003f) packages, e.g., `car`; however, I think it helps to learn how to download and read in csv files, so that is what I ask readers to do. All the necessary files are linked in each chapter.

I have included exercises which all come with solutions; to hide these, simply use the scrollbar to ensure that they are off the edge of the visible part of the screen...^[I originally used the `.tabset` attribute to hide answers; however, it doesn't work for `bookdown`.]

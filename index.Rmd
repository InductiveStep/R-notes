# Preface {-}

These notes are based on weekly tutorial sheets I developed for a postgraduate social science course in 2020. The core texts used were Fox and Weisberg (2019), [An R Companion to Applied Regression (Third Edition)](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/) and Healy (2019) [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/) -- both excellent for learning applied analysis.

All the datasets used are available in CRAN packages, e.g., `car`; however, I think it helps to learn how to download and read in csv files so that is what I ask readers to do.

I have included some activities (an word for "exercise" that I picked up somewhere), which seem to be helpful. They all come with solutions; to hide these, simply use the scrollbar so that they are off the edge of the visible part of the screen... (For those who know R Markdown, originally I used the `.tabset` attribute to hide answers; however, it doesn't work for `bookdown` and I don't want to rely on custom Javascript that may later break.) The GitHub repository is [over here](https://github.com/InductiveStep/R-notes).

I assume you already have [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) installed and know how to type and run R or R Markdown chunks.

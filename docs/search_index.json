[["index.html", "Using R for social research Preface", " Using R for social research Andi Fugard (almost@gmail.com, @InductiveStep) 17 November 2020 Preface These notes are based on weekly tutorial sheets I developed for a postgraduate social science course in 2020 to complement weekly lectures and online tutorials. The core texts used were Fox and Weisberg (2019), An R Companion to Applied Regression (Third Edition) and Healy (2019) Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction  both fabulous for learning applied statistics using R. All the datasets used are available in CRAN packages, e.g., car; however, I think it helps to learn how to download and read in csv files, so that is what I ask readers to do. All the necessary files are linked in each chapter. I have included some activities (a word for exercise that I picked up somewhere). They all come with solutions; to hide these, simply use the scrollbar to ensure that they are off the edge of the visible part of the screen (I originally used the .tabset attribute to hide answers; however, it doesnt work for bookdown.) The GitHub repository is over here. I assume you already have RStudio and R installed and know how to type and run R or R Markdown chunks. If not, try Healys intro over here. Better still, ask someone who knows what Markdown and running a chunk mean to give you a 5 minute demo! Feedback welcome.

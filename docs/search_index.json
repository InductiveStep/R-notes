[["index.html", "Using R for social research (v0.11) Preface", " Using R for social research (v0.11) Andi Fugard (almost@gmail.com, @InductiveStep) 16 November 2020 Preface These notes are based on weekly tutorial sheets I developed for a postgraduate social science course in 2020. The core texts used were Fox and Weisberg (2019), An R Companion to Applied Regression (Third Edition) and Healy (2019) Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction  both excellent for learning applied analysis. All the datasets used are available in CRAN packages, e.g., car; however, I think it helps to learn how to download and read in csv files so that is what I ask readers to do. I have included some activities (an word for exercise that I picked up somewhere), which seem to be helpful. They all come with solutions; to hide these, simply use the scrollbar so that they are off the edge of the visible part of the screen (For those who know R Markdown, originally I used the .tabset attribute to hide answers; however, it doesnt work for bookdown and I dont want to rely on custom Javascript that may later break.) The GitHub repository is over here. I assume you already have RStudio and R installed and know how to type and run R or R Markdown chunks. Feedback welcome! "]]

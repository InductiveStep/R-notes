# Starting RStudio

This is an attempt to explain how to get going super fast, mostly by using animated GIFs. For something more substantial, try Healy's intro [over here](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html).


## Download, install, and run

First ensure that you have installed both [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). RStudio is a friendly user interface which makes it easier to run analyses. R is the software which does the number crunching.

Once both are installed, run RStudio.



## Make a new R Notebook file

## Save the file

## Run the example R command

## Clear it and try a sum

## Did that help?

If so, try the next chapter! Otherwise, I can again recommend [Healy's intro](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html).
